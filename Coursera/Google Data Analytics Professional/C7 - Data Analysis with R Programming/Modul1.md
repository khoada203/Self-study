# The exciting world of programming
## The R-versus-Python debate
| **Programming Language** | **R** | **Python** |
|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| **Common features**       | - Open-source <br> - Data stored in data frames <br> - Formulas and functions readily available <br> - Community of developers for code support | - Open-source <br> - Data stored in data frames <br> - Formulas and functions readily available <br> - Community of developers for code support |
| **Unique advantages**     | - Data manipulation, data visualization, and statistics packages <br> - "Scalpel" approach to data: find packages to do what you want with the data | - Easy syntax for machine learning needs <br> - Integrates with cloud platforms such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Azure |
| **Unique challenges**     | - Inconsistent naming conventions make it more difficult for beginners to select the right functions <br> - Methods for handling variables may be a little complex for beginners to understand | - Many more decisions for beginners to make about data input/output, structure, variables, packages, and objects <br> - "Swiss army knife" approach to data: figure out a way to do what you want with the data |
