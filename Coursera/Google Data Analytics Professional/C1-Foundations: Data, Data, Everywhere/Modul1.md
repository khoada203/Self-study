# 1. Understand the data ecosystem

## 6 stages in data analysis:
1. **Ask phase:** you’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be  answered. It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders. As this is the ask phase, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way.
2. **Prepare phase:** you’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions. You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions.
3. **Process phase:** is when you will clean and organize your data. Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with. Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.
4. **Analyze phase:** is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions. Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.
5. **Share phase:** when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations. As part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include. Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R. 
6. **Act phase:** in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action. This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem.

## What is the data ecosystems

- **Data ecosystems:** The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.
- **Data and gut instinct:** decisions based on gut instinct without any data to back them up can cause mistakes.
  --> Data + business knowledge = mystery solved
