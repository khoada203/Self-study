# Differentiate data formats and structures
- Structured data: Organized in a certain format, such as rows and columns.
- Unstructured data: Not organized in any easy-to-identify way.

## Levels of data modeling

- **Conceptual data modeling** gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization. For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details. 
- **Logical data modeling** focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.
- **Physical data modeling** depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.

# Explore data types, fields, and values
## Transforming data
**Data transformation usually involves:**
- Adding, copying, or replicating data
- Deleting fields or records 
- Standardizing the names of variables
- Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
- Joining one set of data with another
- Saving a file in a different format. For example, saving a spreadsheet as a comma separated values (.csv) file.

**Why transform data?**
- Data organization: better organized data is easier to use
- Data compatibility: different applications or systems can then use the same data
- Data migration: data with matching formats can be moved from one system to another
- Data merging: data with the same organization can be merged together
- Data enhancement: data can be displayed with more detailed fields
- Data comparison: apples-to-apples comparisons of the data can then be made
