# Work with databases
**Relational databases** is a database that contains a series of tables that can be connected to form relationships. Basically, they allow data analysts to organize and link data based on what the data has in common.
**Normalization** is a process of organizing data in a relational database.
- For example, creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables. It is applied to eliminate data redundancy, increase data integrity, and reduce complexity in a database.

**The key to relational databases**
- **primary key** is an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique.
- **foreign key** is a field within a table that is a primary key in another table
