# 1. Defining Data Analyst
Career Path: Associate Data Analyst -> Data Analyst -> Senior DA -> Lead DA -> Principal Analyst

- **Data Engineering** converts raw data into usable data.
- **Data Analytics** uses this data to generate insights.
- **Data Scientists** use Data Analytics and Data Engineering to predict the future using data from the past.
- **Business Analysts** and **Business Intelligence Analysts** use these insights and predictions to drive decisions that benefit and grow their business.

## 1.1 Definition
- Data analysis is the process of gathering, cleaning, analyzing and mining data, interpreting results, and reporting the findings.

## 1.2 Different Types of Data Analysis

| Descriptive Analytics | Diagnostic Analytics | Predictive Analytics | Prescriptive Analytics |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| **"What happened"**<br>Provides insights into past events. | **"Why did it happen"**<br>Takes the insights from descriptive analytics to dig deeper to find the cause of the outcome. | **"What will happen next"**<br>Leverages historical data and trends to predict future outcomes. | **"What should be done about it"**<br>Analyzes past decisions and events to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes. |

## 1.3 The Data Analysis Process

- **1. Setting a clear metric**  
  Deciding what will be measured and how it will be measured.
- **2. Gathering data**  
  Identifying the data you require, the sources from which you will access it, and the best tools for the job.
- **3. Cleaning data**  
  Fixing quality issues in the data and standardizing inputs coming from multiple sources.
- **4. Analyzing and mining data**  
  Extracting, analyzing, and manipulating data from different perspectives to understand trends, identify correlations, and find patterns and variations.
- **5. Interpreting results**  
  Evaluating the results, assessing the defendability of your analysis, and noting circumstances under which it may not hold true.
- **6. Presenting your findings**  
  Communicating and showcasing your insights in clear, impactful, and convincing ways.
